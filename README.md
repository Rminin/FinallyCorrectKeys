# Finally Correct Keys
This mod should correct most of the UI elements to display the keybind the user has set for an action.
Only supports Keyboard keybinds for now.

## Features:
- Replaces the standard keybinds in the control tips (top right)
- Replaces the standard hover interact keybind (grab, open, etc.)
- Replaces the standard ship build mode keybinds
- Disables word wrap on the control tips

## Planned (maybe)
- Fix control tips not updating when changing bind while they're displayed
- Support gamepad keybinds
- Fix the rest of the vanilla UI elements I didn't find yet
