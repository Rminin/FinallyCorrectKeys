# Finally Correct Keys
This mod should correct most of the UI elements to display the keybind the user has set for an action.
Only supports Keyboard keybinds for now.

## Features:
- Replaces the standard keybinds in the control tips (top right)
- Replaces the standard hover interact keybind (grab, open, etc.)
- Replaces the standard ship build mode keybinds
- Option to control word wrap on the control tips (configurable)
- Option to hide control tips entirely (configurable)

## Compatibilites
- [LobbyCompatibility](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BMX/LobbyCompatibility/) by [BMX](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BMX/)
- [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) by [AinaVT](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/)

## Planned (maybe)
- Fix control tips not updating when changing bind while they're displayed
- Support gamepad keybinds
- Fix the rest of the vanilla UI elements I didn't find yet
